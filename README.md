### Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product designer on the Actions team at GitHub. I've started here in 2012 so I've the opportunity to work on lots of different things including the pull request merge box UI, repository topics, the user profile page, [signed commits UI](https://github.blog/2016-04-05-gpg-signature-verification/), the [default Pages theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme/), tons of internal projects, and even a [t-shirt](https://github.myshopify.com/collections/shirts/products/arctocat).

I'm a big Vim nerd and have written a [plugin](https://github.com/jasonlong/vim-textobj-css) and [a color theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/lavalamp) (though I now use a [customized version of Nord](https://github.com/jasonlong/nordish-vim) with higher contrast).

Recently I've been playing with Blender as well as [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

#### Logos

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a few logos for open source projects.
